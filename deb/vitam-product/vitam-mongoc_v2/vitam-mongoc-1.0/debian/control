Description: Service files for Vitam mongoc cluster configuration nodes
 MongoDB is built for scalability, performance and high availability,
   scaling from single server deployments to large,
   complex multi-site architectures. By leveraging in-memory computing,
   MongoDB provides high performance for both reads and writes.
   MongoDBâ€™s native replication and automated failover enable enterprise-grade
   reliability and operational flexibility.
 MongoDB is an open-source database used by companies of all sizes,
   across all industries and for a wide variety of applications.
   It is an agile database that allows schemas to change quickly as
   applications evolve, while still providing the functionality
   developers expect from traditional databases, such as secondary indexes,
   a full query language and strict consistency.
 MongoDB has a rich client ecosystem including hadoop integration,
   officially supported drivers for 10 programming languages and environments,
   as well as 40 drivers supported by the user community.
