 * <h3>Overriding ProcessId</h3> To override the processId, one can use the following property:<br>
 *
 * <pre>
 *  -Dfr.gouv.vitam.processId=nnnnn
 * </pre>
 *
 * Where nnnnn is a number between 0 and 2^22 (4194304). <br>
 * <br>
 * <h3>GUID Factory</h3> Usage:<br>
 * One should use the appropriate helper according to the type of the object for the GUID.<br>
 * For instance:
 * <ul>
 * <li>For a Unit and associated Unit Logbook:
 *
 * <pre>
 * GUID unitGuid = newUnitGUID(tenantId);
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>For an ObjectGroup and associated ObjectGroup Logbook:
 *
 * <pre>
 * GUID objectGroupGuid = newObjectGroupGUID(tenantId);
 * or
 * GUID objectGroupGuid = newObjectGroupGUID(unitParentGUID);
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>For an Object and associated Binary object:
 *
 * <pre>
 * GUID objectGuid = newObjectGUID(tenantId);
 * or
 * GUID objectGuid = newObjectGUID(objectGroupParentGUID);
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>For an Operation (process):
 *
 * <pre>
 * GUID operationGuid = newOperationIdGUID(tenantId);
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>For a Request Id:
 *
 * <pre>
 * GUID requestIdGuid = newRequestIdGUID(tenantId);
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li></li>
 * <li>For a SIP / Manifest / Seda like informations Id:
 *
 * <pre>
 * GUID manifestGuid = newManifestGUID(tenantId);
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>For an Logbook daily Id (Operation, Write):
 *
 * <pre>
 * GUID writeLogbookGuid = newWriteLogbookGUID(tenantId);
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li>
 * <li>For storage operation Id:
 *
 * <pre>
 * GUID storageOperationGuid = newStorageOperationGUID(tenantId);
 * </pre>
 *
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h3>Attention</h3> <b>No one should not in general use directly newUuid helpers.</b><br>
 * Those methods are for special unknown yet usages.
